# ampersand ec

This an open-source (and highly experimental!!!) EC (topre) pcb for the Ampersand keyboard designed by whitefacemountain. Ampersand is a gummyworm mounted 13.5u keyboard with minimum 40s support needed.

## Warning:

- *DO NOT USE THE CURRENT PRODUCTION FILES!!!* they are out of date!

- *As the Ampersand case is designed for an MX pcb, the EC pcb requires testing. There is no garantuee that it would fit into the case without modifications of at least a few topre housings and perhaps another oring.*
